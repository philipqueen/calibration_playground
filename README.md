Find Jon's example at: https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/blob/jon/src-necromancy/src/core_processor/camera_calibration/lens_distortion_calibrator.py

Need to find some way to filter for only good/different frames - we don't need as many views as we're getting, but we need good views with as different poses as possible
